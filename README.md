# Smart Street Lighting System

Currently, in the whole world, enormous electric energy is consumed by the street lights, which are automatically turn on when it becomes dark and automatically turn off when it becomes bright. This is the huge waste of energy in the whole world and should be changed. This project is an attempt to implement a smart street light system.The main aim of smart street light systems is that lights turn on when needed and turn off when not needed. Moreover, the smart street light system in this project behaves like usual street lights that turn on all night. The ideal behaviour of the smart street light system is that no one finds turn-off of street lights at night. Whenever something approaches the proximity sensor triggered street lights, they turn on and whenever it senses no motion the street lights turn off. The smart street light system consists of LED lights, brightness sensors, motion sensors and short-distance communication networks. The lights turn on before pedestrians and vehicles come and turn off or reduce brightness when there is no one. It will be difficult for pedestrians and drivers of vehicles to distinguish our smart street lights and the conventional street lights because our street lights all turn on before they come.
